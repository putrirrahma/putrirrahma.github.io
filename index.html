<p style ="text-align:center;"> You will be mine<br>
Even if you're somebody elses<br>
Girl not for long<br>
Girl not for long<br>
Cause I'm your type<br>
If you've got the wrong impression<br>
Girl not for long, girl not for long<br>
</p>

<p style ="text-align:center;"> Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow<br>
Maybe at the club, maybe at the bar<br>
I wanna show you off like a trophy car (whip it)<br>
Cause anything is better than nothing at all<br>
Nothing at all, Nothing on you<br>
I just wanna show you a table for two<br>
All you did was go on a date with a dude<br>
You know he don't fit, he ain't tailored for you<br>
You just on a nigga dick cause he sold a brick<br>
Has he ever wrote a hit on some poet shit?<br>
That's who you chillin' on the sofa with?<br>
I ain't trippin' in a minute it'll be over with, aye<br>
</p>

<p style ="text-align:center;"> You will be mine<br>
Even if you're somebody elses<br>
Girl not for long<br>
Girl not for long<br>
Cause I'm your type<br>

Girl not for long, girl not for long<br>
</p>

<p style ="text-align:center;"> Oooh...Oooh...Ooohh<br>
Girl not for long<br>

Oooh...Oooh...Ooohh<br>
Girl not for long<br>
Girl not for long<br>
</p>

<p style ="text-align:center;"> When they see us together, hell naw they can't stand it <br>
I wonder if you're matchin' you bras with them panties<br>
A gorgeous skin tan, hit the mall and do damage<br>
The way she hit the high notes, we all gon' have grammys<br>
This marble not granite (tip toein')<br>
From the counter, to the shower, for a hour<br>
Super powers, super powers<br>
That's that mojo, Austin Powers
Search "real nigga", I'ma pop up in your browser<br>
Aye, so go and get your body wet<br>
Panties off, we ain't made it to the lobby yet<br>
Put you on game girl so it's obvious<br>
I gave you the world if you ain't go it yet<br>
</p>

<p style ="text-align:center;"> You will be mine<br>
Even if you're somebody elses<br>

Girl not for long<br>
Oooh...Oooh...Ooohh<br>

<p style ="text-align:center;"> You might leave, with someone else <br>
But I still see <br>
You fiend a be with a G like me <br>
You'll never need, no one else <br>
And I know, you know <br>
I'ma be like I told you so <br>
</p>

Girl not for long, girl not for long<br>
